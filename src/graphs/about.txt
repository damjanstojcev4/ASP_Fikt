Overview of Graphs:

Vertices: In a graph, vertices represent entities or points, such as cities in a map or nodes in a network.

Edges: Edges represent connections or relationships between vertices.
They can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).

Types of Graphs:

 - Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.
 - Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction, connecting vertices in both directions.
 - Weighted Graph: Edges have associated weights or costs.
 - Cyclic Graph: Contains cycles (loops).
 - Acyclic Graph: Does not contain cycles.
 - Connected Graph: All vertices are reachable from any other vertex.
 - Disconnected Graph: Contains isolated components.

Graph Representation:
There are various ways to represent graphs, including adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list.
The choice of representation depends on the specific problem and the efficiency of operations you need.
