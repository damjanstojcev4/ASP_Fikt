Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It works by dividing the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part.
In each iteration, the algorithm finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps
it with the first element in the unsorted part. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

public class SelectionSort {
    // This line declares a Java class named SelectionSort.

    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        // This line defines a public static method named selectionSort, which takes an integer array as input.

        int n = arr.length;
        // Declare an integer variable 'n' and assign it the length of the input array 'arr'.

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // This is the start of the outer loop. It iterates through the unsorted part of the array.

            int minIndex = i;
            // Declare an integer variable 'minIndex' and initialize it with the current 'i' index as the assumed minimum.

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                // This is the start of the inner loop. It searches for the minimum element in the unsorted part.

                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    // Compare the element at index 'j' with the current minimum element.
                    // If the element at index 'j' is smaller, update 'minIndex' to 'j'.
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element in the unsorted part.
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            // Create a temporary variable 'temp' to hold the minimum element's value.
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            // Replace the element at 'minIndex' with the element at the current 'i' index.
            arr[i] = temp;
            // Replace the element at the current 'i' index with the stored minimum value.
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
        // Declare and initialize an integer array 'arr' with some values.

        selectionSort(arr);
        // Call the 'selectionSort' method to sort the array 'arr'.

        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        // Print a message to indicate the sorted array will be displayed.
        for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
            // Iterate through the sorted array and print each element followed by a space.
        }
    }
}


Selection sort, while simple and easy to understand, is not commonly used in real-world projects or practice for large datasets.
It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which makes it inefficient for large lists.
There are more efficient sorting algorithms, like quicksort, mergesort, or even built-in sorting functions in programming languages,
such as Arrays.sort() in Java.

However, selection sort can still be useful in some specific scenarios:
 - Educational Purposes: Selection sort is often used in computer science and programming courses to teach students about sorting algorithms and the concept of in-place sorting.
 - Small Data Sets: In situations where you are working with very small datasets, selection sort's simplicity might be preferable over more complex sorting algorithms.
 - Embedded Systems: In resource-constrained environments, such as some embedded systems, selection sort might be chosen due to its low memory usage and straightforward implementation.
 - As a Component: Selection sort can be used as a component within more advanced sorting algorithms. For example, it's used in the initial stages of heapsort.
 - Debugging and Testing: It can also be useful for debugging and verifying the correctness of other sorting algorithms.
   Since it's easy to implement, you can use it to check if a more complex sorting algorithm produces the correct results.

In real-world projects where sorting is a critical component, you would typically prefer more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.
These algorithms have average and worst-case time complexities of O(n log n), making them much faster for larger datasets.
Java's built-in sorting methods, such as Arrays.sort(), use more advanced algorithms under the hood and are optimized for performance.

So, while selection sort has its place, it's usually not the first choice in real-world applications when you're dealing with larger or more complex datasets.
