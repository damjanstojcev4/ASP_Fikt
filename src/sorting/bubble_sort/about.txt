Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

public class BubbleSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an array to be sorted
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};

        // Get the length of the array
        int n = arr.length;

        // Variable to track if any swaps were made in a pass
        boolean swapped;

        // Outer loop to traverse through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;

            // Inner loop to compare and swap adjacent elements
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no swaps were made in this pass, the array is already sorted
            if (!swapped) {
                break;
            }
        }

        // Print the sorted array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}

This code demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java.
It iterates through the array, repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order.
This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, and while it's not particularly efficient for large datasets,
it can still find use in certain practical scenarios:
 - Educational Purposes: Bubble sort is often used to teach the concept of sorting algorithms and the basic principles of algorithm design and analysis.
It's a straightforward way to introduce the idea of comparing and swapping elements to achieve a desired order.
 - Small Datasets: In situations where the dataset is small and efficiency is not a critical factor, bubble sort can be applied.
For tiny arrays or lists, its simplicity may outweigh its inefficiency.
 - Hardware-Level Sorting: In embedded systems or low-level programming on microcontrollers with limited resources,
bubble sort might be used because it requires minimal memory and is easy to implement.
 - Adaptive Sorting: Bubble sort is adaptive, meaning it performs well on almost sorted data.
If you expect your data to be partially sorted, bubble sort may be a reasonable choice.
 - Visual Demonstrations: Bubble sort is often used in sorting algorithm visualizations and educational materials to demonstrate the basic principles of sorting.
 - Benchmarking and Analysis: Bubble sort can be used as a baseline for benchmarking and comparing the performance of other,
 more complex sorting algorithms. It helps illustrate the performance differences between sorting methods.

It's important to note that in most practical software development and real-world projects,
more efficient sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or the built-in sorting methods in programming languages
(e.g., Arrays.sort() in Java) are preferred for larger datasets.
These algorithms have much better average and worst-case time complexity, making them more suitable for production use.

Bubble sort is rarely used in high-performance, large-scale applications due to its O(n^2) time complexity,
where 'n' is the number of elements to be sorted.
In most scenarios, faster sorting algorithms are favored to optimize resource usage and performance.
