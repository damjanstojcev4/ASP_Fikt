Algorithm Overview:
Binary search takes advantage of the fact that the list or array must be sorted.
It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found or it's clear that the element is not in the list.

Start with the entire sorted list and define two pointers,
one at the beginning and one at the end.

Calculate the middle index between the two pointers.

Compare the middle element with the target element.

 - If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful, and the algorithm returns the index of the target element.
 - If the middle element is greater than the target, it means the target must be in the left half of the array.
 The search interval is updated accordingly, and the process is repeated in the left half.
 - If the middle element is less than the target, the target must be in the right half of the array.
 The search interval is updated, and the process is repeated in the right half.
Repeat the process until the target is found or the search interval becomes empty, indicating that the target is not in the list.

Key Points:

- Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm, with a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case,
where n is the number of elements in the sorted list.
- It is important that the list is sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- Binary search can be much faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.
