Overview of Trees:

Nodes: Each element in a tree is called a node. Nodes have attributes,
which may include data and references to other nodes (child nodes).

Root: The topmost node in a tree is called the root.

Parent and Child Nodes: Nodes in a tree can be classified as parents
(nodes with children) and children (nodes connected to a parent). The edge connecting a parent to its child is called a branch.

Leaves: Nodes with no children are called leaves.

Levels: The root is at level 0, and each level below the root increases by 1.

Height: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

Types of Trees:

Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with the property that the left child's value is less than the parent's value,
and the right child's value is greater.
